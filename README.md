# Fullscreen APP for Windows

This program was made as a game/program launcher, it gets and saves the current resolution of the Windows OS (widht and height in pixels), then it changes the resolution (to one available), then after closing the game it returns to the original resolution (the one that was set before).

To do this job it uses a binary program licensed under BSD.
